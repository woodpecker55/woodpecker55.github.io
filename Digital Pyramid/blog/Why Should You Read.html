<h1>Why Should You Read</h1>
<br/>
<h2>A Moral Duty</h2>

<p>Employ Your time in improving yourself by other men's writings so that you shall gain easily what
others have labored hard for. - Socrates</p>

<p>Remember Comrades that our Brothers and Sisters have <i>Gifted a Piece of Themselves.</i> Some Inspire
Feelings & Arts, Others Knowledge & Wisdom.</p>

<p>Each has their Place, Standing Guard & Teaching yet to leave the <b>Frontlines.</b></p>

<h2>Understanding the Present</h2>

<p>The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding - Leonardo Da Vinci</p>

<p>It can make even the most Irrational System and Event a bit more Rational to Perceive.</p>

<h2>Stop being Illiterate</h2>

<p>Can help one become a Better Voting Citizen and as an extra you will gain the skills of Writing,
Speech and Perspective.</p>

<p>A Question to you my Friend - <i>"If one where to be Literate, would they be Educated as well?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Are Literacy & Education the Same?"</i></p>

<h2>Soften Solitude</h2>

<p>You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you
read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that
connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive. - <i>James A Baldwin</i></p>

<p><b>Life is Suffering, Art is Pain</b> - You cannot know happiness till you have known sadness. One
cannot Exist without the Other. People can also just be people and at Times a book is better
company.</p>

<p>Yin / Yang</p>

<h2>Connect to the Past</h2>

<p>There are <u>Values / Idea's , Treasures</u> forgotten waiting to be Recovered.</p>

<p>Learn the Patterns of the Past to Sail the Patterns of the Future.</p>

<p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it - <i>George Santayana</i></p>

<p>- Domino Effect = 1 +1 = 2...</p>

<h2>Build a Habit :</h2>

<p>- Moral excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts, temperate
by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. - <i>Aristotle</i></p>

<p>- We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit - Aristotle</p>

<h2>Re - Read Books :</h2>

<p>- No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. -
