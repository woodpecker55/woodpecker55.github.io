    <h1>Kwame Ture – Making the Unconscious,
Conscious</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>

<h1>Kwame Ture – Making the Unconscious,
Conscious</h1>

<p>“Our task is not to teach the unconscious to be conscious but to make them conscious of their
unconscious behaviour because unconscious, instinctively they seek Freedom.</p>

<p>What we must do, is make them conscious.</p>

<p>Look you want Freedom anyway, let’s be serious, let’s sit down, let’s plan it, let’s wage protracted
war and let’s tear down the system and let’s walk on to Liberation.</p>

<p>It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>Those of us who are revolutionary, are not concerned with issues, we are concerned with the
system.</p>

<p>We must know clearly the difference between Mobilization and Organisation</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of Mobilization is that it is temporary</p>

<p>Organisation is permanent and eternal</p>

<p>Clear differences must be made because the unconscious, can usually be captured easily around one
issue item’s, around Mobilization item’s but it’s hard to catch them around organisation but these
unconscious must be brought to organisation.</p>

<p>We must transform Mobilization to Organisation</p>

<p>If we are not careful, we allow Mobilization to become events.</p>

<p>The Struggle is never a event, it’s a process, ah continual eternal processYou know our theme is Organisation,</p>

<p>We want POWER</p>
<p>We don’t want money</p>
<p>We don’t want fame</p>
<p>We don’t want fortune</p>
<p>We don’t want popularity</p>
<p>We Want POWER...POWER</p>

<p>And POWER comes only from the Organised MASSES</p>

<p>As Pan – Africanist we have every right to be concerned with it.</p>

<p>African after all is the richest continent on the face of the Earth, properly Organised she will be the
most Powerful Continent on the face of the Earth</p>

<p>Therefore our drive to POWER is clear.</p>

<p>A MASS Party</p>

<p>Every African in the world inside our body</p>

<p>That’s what I’m working for and if I don’t get it, my granddaughter ganna get it but I’m working for
it.</p>

<p>We will never tire of saying it, Capitalism does not LIE some of the time, it LIES all of the time.
When it tells the Truth it’s the result of a Double Lie. It’s a logical fact</p>

<p>So Capitalism has us believe you can’t organise all the people around the same thing</p>

<p>That’s not true</p>

<p>You can organise all the people around One thing – TRUTH</p>

<p>Now what Capitalism will try to make it appear, as if the truth is not one truth but anybody can have
the truth.</p>

<p>This is stupidity</p>

<p>Nobody is born with the truth inside of them, if they were they wouldn’t need to live</p>

<p>We come to know the truth from outside of us</p>

<p>Some people think they know the truth because they were born to know the Truth, that’s a Lie</p>

<p>You know the TRUTH from constant Struggle against LIES</p>

<p>That’s how you know the TRUTH</p>

<p>For example they try make it appear, as if we Africans will not arrive at Uniting ourselves even
around the question of our Identity.</p>

<p>You may call some of the Africans but some call themselves Black, some still call themselves
Coloured.</p>

<p>That’s fact but this is because they have been miss educated by a system which seeks to keep us
divided and this is the TRUTH</p>

<p>We must be One Thing</p>

<p>We are Africans, end of discussion</p>

<p>This Struggle is not a easy struggle</p>

<p>The Struggle to go from Negro to Black was a difficult struggle</p>

<p>Capitalism did everything to roll it back, even had us confused</p>

<p>I’m not Black, look at me I’m brown coloured. Yes</p>

<p>I’m not Black I got Indian blood in me. Oh</p>

<p>What nonsense they didn’t have us say, just to run away from the TRUTH</p>

<p>Once your just African, ain’t no question</p>

<p>All Africans, Once you have proper identity, one of your biggest problems SOLVED</p>

<p>Because a People must know their National Interest, A People must have a cleat understanding of
their National Interests</p>

<p>The first Conscious act in Organising our People is to let them know who they are</p>

<p>A African United Front</p>

<p>My Brother’s and Sister’s, I will tell you the Truth</p>

<p>You must never get discouraged in struggle. You will build something and the enemy will knock it
down and you have to start from zero.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the easiest way for the enemy to take you out, is to make you frustrated and
disgusted:</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Oh I went to that meeting, they ain’t doing nothing, I ain’t got not time for them, till they get
serious, I ain’t going there.</p>

<p>What you doing?I ain’t doing nothing</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>And they really think they are intelligent, they think they made a great statement.</p>

<p>In spite of obstacles, you must do your work</p>

<p>In spite of obstacles, you must persevere</p>

<p>Chinese say if you make a error and you know it’s a error, you don’t correct the error, you made
your second error</p>

<p>Our People have only one stage left in their struggle and that is MASS Organisation</p>

<p>Malcolm X was assassinated when he was in-between Organisations, Building Organisations.</p>

<p>I saw quickly.</p>

<p>I said Ooh, so they killed him before he got his Organisations off the ground</p>

<p>If Malcolm X had got his Organisations off the ground, they couldn’t touch him that easily because
Malcolm X was not a Mobilizer, he was a Organiser</p>

<p>History plays it’s self out, even if the leaders play themselves out</p>

<p>History Will Not Be Denied</p>

<p>Our People are looking for direction and the conscious must provide direction</p>

<p>And the direction the conscious must provide is to make the unconscious, conscious of their
unconscious behaviour</p>

<p>So no master plan is necessary here</p>

<p>The people are looking of Unity</p>

<p>Let’s give them Unity in a United Front</p>

<p>The people are looking for POWER</p>

<p>Let’s give them Organisations</p>

<p>The masses want Unity</p>

<p>Let’s move from Mass Mobilization to MASS Organisation</p>

<p>We intend to Organise Africans in Africa, Africans in the Caribbean, Africans in South and Central
America, Africans in the United States of America, Africans in Canada, Africans in Europe,
Africans in Africa into ONE Organisation</p>

<p>A African United Front”</p>
