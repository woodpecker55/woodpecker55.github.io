    <h1>Code Of Conduct</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    
    <h1>Code Of Conduct (This Must Be Done By The Collective)</h1>
    
    <p>Symbolic - THE LAW = A Code Of Conduct</p>
    
    <p>So Codes Of Conduct Must Be Agreed On All Levels = Not All Levels Will Have The Same Code Of Conduct But Yet Each Must Have One</p>
    
    <h2>Levels:</h2>
    
    <p>Heavens</p>
    
    <p>International</p>
    
    <p>Country</p>
    
    <p>State</p>
    
    <p>Provice</p>
    
    <p>City</p>
    
    <p>Community</p>
    
    <p>House</p>
    
    <p>Faiths / Religion</p>
    
    <p>Underworld</p>
    
    <p>Once Each Has Created A Code Of Conduct, It Must Be Collected & Shared To Allow The Collective Understanding Of The Game (So To Speak) That As A Collective, Agree To Play = Balance</p>
    
    <p>Reason For This Is, In A Global World - Other Codes Of Conduct That Are Of Outside Country's Can Take Over Your Collectivlly Agreement.</p>
    
    <p>A Symbolic = Idea Of This Would Be:</p>
    <p>China - On A Country Level</p>
    <p>Russia - On A Religious Level</p>
    <p>Rasta - On A Culture Level</p>
