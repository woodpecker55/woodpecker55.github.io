<h1>Emerald Tablet</h1>

<p><b>The Emerald Tablet is an ancient artifact that reveals a profound spiritual technology, which has
survived to this day despite centuries of effort to suppress it. Encoded within the tablet's
mysterious wording is a powerful formula that works in very specific and comprehensible steps
on all levels of reality at once -- the physical, the mental, and the spiritual -- and shows us how to
achieve personal transformation and even accelerate the evolution of our species.</b></p>

<p><b>The source of alchemy and the Hermetic sciences, the tablet's universal approach made it
forbidden knowledge, condemned by patriarchal powers for thousands of years, from the
Egyptian priesthood, to the medieval Church, to our modern politicians and religious leaders.
To ensure the survival of such "dangerous" principles, which guide people to higher states of
consciousness, the ancients concealed their knowledge in a succinct declaration that has
become a time capsule of wisdom for future generations.</b></p>

<p><b>Molded out of a single piece of green crystal, the Emerald Tablet carries a prophetic message
full of hidden meaning. Although its true origin is lost in legends that go back over 10,000
years, the wondrous artifact was translated into Greek by Alexandrian scholars and actually
put on display in Egypt in 330 BC.</b></p>

<p><b>Around the year 400 AD, it was reportedly buried somewhere on the Giza plateau to protect it
from religious zealots who were burning libraries around the world at that time. Many believe
the tablet still lies hidden there.</b></p>

<p><b>Working only with these early translations, many seekers of truth recognized in subsequent
centuries that the Emerald Tablet contained a secret formula for transforming reality.</b></p>

<h1>Sacred Text</h1>

<p>It is true without untruth, certain and most true</p>

<p>That which is below is like that which is on high, and that which is on high is like that which is
below; by these things are made the miracles of one thing.</p>

<p>And as all things are, and come from One, by the mediation of One, So all things are born from this
unique thing by adaptation.</p>

<p>The Sun is the father and the Moon the mother.</p>

<p>The wind carries it in its stomach. The Earth is its nourisher and its receptacle.</p>

<p>The Father of all the works of the universal world is here.</p>

<p>Its force, or power, remains entire.</p>

<p>If it is converted into Earth.</p>

<p>You separate the Earth from the Fire, the subtle from the gross, gently with great industry.</p>

<p>It climbs from the Earth and descends from the sky, and receives the force of things superior and
things inferior.</p>

<p>You will have by this way, the glory of the world and all obscurity will flee from you.</p>

<p>It is the power strong with all power, for it will defeat every subtle thing and penetrate every solid
thing.</p>

<p>In this way the world was created.</p>

<p>From it are born wonderful adaptations, of which the way here is given.</p>

<p>That is why I have been called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the universal
philosophy.</p>

<p>This, that I have called the solar Work, is complete.</p>
