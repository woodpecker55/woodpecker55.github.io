    <i>Introduction</i>

    <p>
There are indeed mistakes made, through the fault of our advisors, who teach us how to debate and
not how to live. There are also mistakes made by students, who come to their teachers to develop,
not their souls, but their wits. Thus philosophy, the study of wisdom, has become philology, the
study of words. - "Seneca"
<br/>
<p><b>The Platonic Academy is a nursery, fostering the Gift of Curiosity.</b></p>
<p><b>The Platonic Academy is to be used as a tool/utility to assist the
initiate through the challenges of the Abyss.</b></p>
<p><b>In a Quest for Knowing One's Self.</b></p>
<p><b>Follow the White Rabbit, Alice. Find The Matrix</b></p>
    <br/>
    <p>Poetry is finer and more philosophical than History, For poetry expresses the universal and History
only the particular - "Aristotle"</p>
<p>Practice non-action. Work without doing. Magnify the small; Increase the few. Reward bitterness
with care - "Lao Tzu"</p>
<p>Zen concentrates on the importance of seeing into one's own nature, now at this moment - not in
five minutes when you have had time to "ACCEPT" yourself, nor ten years ahead when you have
time to retire to the mountains and meditate - "Alan Watts"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Philosophy/Alpha&Omega</h2>
<br/>
<p><b>The Path that the Stoic's most admired was the Lifestyle of Philosophy,
Truth.</b></p>
<p><b>An Essence of Human History & Culture that has survived from the original
Stem of the Great Tree.</b></p>
<p><b>Which has birthed All.</b></p>
<p><b>Its an Idea that words can't do justice to explain and should be read with a grain
of salt, which is ironic sense it is most treasured, which is for the best as the
Truth is hidden in the Abyss.</b></p>
<p><b>Beware the Eyes, Hounds Guard & Watch</b></p>
<br/>
<p>Good means not merely not to do wrong, but rather not to desire to do wrong. - "Democritus"</p>
<p>Much learning does not teach understanding. - "Heraclitus"</p>
<p>Medicine to produce health must examine disease; and music, to create harmony must investigate
discord. - "Plutarch"</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Follow the White Rabbit, Alice. Wonderland awaits.</b></p>
<p><b>Beware for The Matrix is limitless.</b></p>
<p><b>Madness is the Key to Knowing & Cures</b></p>
<br/>
<p>The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>If all misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion, most
people would be contented to take their own and depart. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>I only wish that ordinary people had an unlimited capacity for doing harm; then they might have an
unlimited power for doing good. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry, but a kind of instinct or
inspiration, such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without
knowing in the least what they mean. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>If a man is proud of his wealth, he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it. -
"Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>I was really too honest a man to be a politician and live. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>One who is injured ought not to return the injury, for on no account can it be right to do an injustice;
and it is not right to return an injury, or to do evil to any man, however much we have suffered from
him. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>The poets are only the interpreters of the gods. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>The end of life is to be like God, and the soul following God will be like Him. - "Socrates"</p>

Gravity = Full Formula / (0+1+0 = 1)</b><p>
