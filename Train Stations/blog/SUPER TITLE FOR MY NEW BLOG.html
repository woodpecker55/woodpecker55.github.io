    <i>4 Virtues of Stoicism</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <h2>Courage...then be brave</h2>
    <br/>
<p>Pitied people who have never experienced misfortune. You have passed through life without an
opponent, No one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you. - "Seneca"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Temperance...then moderation and sobriety</h2>
<br/>
<p>Capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, and running by
running... therefore, if you want to do something, make a habit of it. - "Epictetus"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Justice...then doing what's right</h2>
<br/>
<p>The source of all the other virtues. - "Marcus Aurelius"</p>
<br/>
<p>Bearing the Cross. - "Martin Luther King Jr"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Wisdom...than truth and understanding</h2>
<br/>
<p>The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth is that we may listen the more and talk the
less. - "Zeno"</p>
<br/>
<p>Wisdom. The knowing. The learning. The experience required to navigate the world.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Stoic Habits</h2>
<br/>
<p><b>Identify what is in your control & what is not</b></p>
<br/>
<p>Work & Concern yourself with what is in your control. The Rest, allow the cards/dice to fall where
they may.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Practice/Journal/Habit</b></p>
<br/>
<p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. - "Aristotle"</p>
<br/>
<p>As it is not one swallow or a fine day that makes a spring, so it is not one day or a short time that
makes a man blessed and happy. - "Aristotle"</p>
<br/>
<p>Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. - "Samuel Beckett"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Practice Misfortune</h2>
<br/>
<p>Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was
once among the things you only hoped for. - "Epicurus"</p>
<br/>
<p>Moral excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts, temperate by
doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. - "Aristotle"</p>
<br/>
<p>Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul. - "Democritus"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Train Perceptions</h2>
<br/>
<p>When you are offended at any man’s fault, turn to yourself and study your own failings. Then you
will forget your anger. - "Epictetus"</p>
<br/>
<p>Throw moderation to the winds, and the greatest pleasures bring the greatest pains. - "Democritus"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Moments in Time & Spaces</h2>
<br/>
<p>It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. - "Epictetus"</p>
<br/>
<p>The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon
mere survival. - "Aristotle"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Take the View from Above</h2>
<br/>
<p>There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot. -
"Plato"</p>
<br/>
<p>It is hard to contend against one’s heart’s desire; for whatever it wishes to have it buys at the cost of
soul. - "Heraclitus"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Memento Mori [Acceptance of Death]</h2>
<br/>
<p>Ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the right way tophilosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death. -
"Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<p>Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us
balance life’s books each day. ... The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is
never short of time. - "Seneca"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Dream of possible Futures, the Good & the Evil</h2>
<br/>
<p>True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves,
and the world around us. - "Socrates"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Amor Fati [a Love of Fate]</h2>
<br/>
<p>He has the most who is most content with the least. - "Diogenes"</p>
<br/>
<p>That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely
bear what is necessary, still less conceal it....but love it. - "Friedrich Nietzsche"</p>
<br/>
<p>Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day.
Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character. - "Heraclitus"</p>
<br/>
<p>Fate is the endless chain of causation, whereby things are; the reason or formula by which the world
goes on. - "Citium Zeno"</p>
<br/>
