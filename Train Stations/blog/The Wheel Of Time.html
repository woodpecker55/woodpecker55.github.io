<p>A Church in Barcelona, it was made by the Moors ( Black Africans ) while they Ruled in Italy &
these Relics / Artifacts are Forgotten Technology & Can't be reproduced</p>

<p>WE know this because WE asked, They are just trying to maintain it but can not. As they no longer
build like this anymore.</p>

<p>Thus it will disappear / Same goes for other Old World Structures</p>
<p>The Knowledge of the Old World has been Forgotten</p>
<p>Thus the Wheel Of Time - you could even say they are Relics of a Older Time:</p>
<p>Like they do in The Lord Of The Rings ( the Power Rings are Ancient Technology )</p>

<p>But do you see what I mean by the Wheel Of Time</p>
<p>What kind of Mind / Spiritual people build this kind of Relics of the past.</p>

<p>Because we know they where humans</p>
<p>Thy don't think we are advanced, we live in Shiny Barbarism</p>
<p>These relics come from civil people, from a True Civilization</p>

<p>That's why thy don't trust those in leadership / this stuff hides in plain sight and we don't see it
because our MINDS are Enslaved</p>

<p>Makes you wonder what was stolen or forgotten, SOULS? MINDS? MEMORY?</p>

<p>Where did that inner beauty go that made this possible?</p>

<p>Do we truly worship God / Universal Force because The Ancient World did in BODY & SOUL.</p>
<p>The Relics speak for themselves</p>

<p>And this is just what you see at the surface level, it gets scary diving into the abyss, to see what
True Spiritual Connection can Create & Reveal.</p>

<p>Imagine Ancient Tradition & Culture & the Ancient World</p>
<p>Ancient Africa / India / China / America / Russia etc...</p>

<p>Thus the Wheel Of Time will Break & we will become Relics of a Forget Age</p>

<p>The TRUTH is no Catholic / Christian or Any True Religious / Spiritual Human Being would have
Left Any Child to Face this Problem ( Climate Change / Sixth Mass Extinction )</p>

<p>That's what Spiritual Blackout means & thus what does this Truth Reveal about US ALL</p>

<p>People have Lost their Minds & Souls</p>
<p>The Price for Lies & Silence & Denial is Deep</p>

<p>But we Endure</p>
<p>Follow the Way Of The Leaf</p>
<p>Unity by Diversity</p>

<p>“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its
contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not
meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto
harmed us little, but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such
terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the
revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.” - H.P.
Lovecraft (The Call of Cthulhu)</p>

<p>“To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or dimension, one must forget
that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a
negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all.” - H.P. Lovecraft’s Letter
to Farnworth Wright (1927)</p>

<p>“There are things that will happen, that will make you Feel Powerless, that will make you Feel
Insignificant. That’s it, they just feelings & sometime you have to Stop Feeling & Start Doing.</p>
<p>Do you know what we are Sitting On?</p>
<p>A Lot of ENERGY, with no where to GO</p>
<p>You Lose your Sense of Time in the Dark</p>
<p>So lets Light this Shit Up”</p>
<p>- (Underwater 2020 Film)</p>
