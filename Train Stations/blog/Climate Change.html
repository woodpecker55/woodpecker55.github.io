    <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p><i>Do you think Climate Change is Real?</i></p>
    
<p>Thy don't want to Assume anymore that Chaos won't Arise in my Lifetime</p>

<p>Thy Looks around the World & See's Mass Flooding / Fire / Draught Globally
& Even Tornadoâ€™s of Fire - "Bloody Hell"</p>

<p>For Forget the Rich Hiding in Space & Hiding in Private Bunkers before the Global Economic
Collapse nor Nuclear War & worrying about how they will control their Armies when Money
becomes Meaningless.</p>

<p>They played GOD & Failed, as the Universal GOD has turned their Nuclear Bunkers into Watery
Tombs.</p>
<p>Talk about The Flood (Climate Change)</p>

<p>The more thy Learns, The more thy Realizes</p>
<p>Climate Change is not a New Problem</p>
<p>The Oracles (Scientists) have spoken for Decades & have been Ignored</p>
<p>&</p>
<p>New Generations will Pay the Price for the Choices of those who came before.</p>
<p>(The Irony of a Greek Myth of Prophecy - Carl Sagan)</p>

<p>Think About It</p>

<p>Will Childhood Homes / Cities / Towns be Gone is some Form or Other</p>
<p>Telling Stories to Grandchildren of what was Once More, As if it was the Mythical City of Atlantis</p>
<p>IF thee is Luck to Live through the Change.</p>

<p>If that is the Case, Does Status & Money mean anything?</p>
<p>Then Family & Community is the only thing that Matters but we are sacrificing that for Status &
Money for a World that won't Exist</p>
<p>Thus Wasting our Lives for What?</p>

<p>Do you see the Paradox ?</p>

<p>Why are people playing Game Of Thrones, when there will be no Throne to Fight for?</p>
<p>It's like Playing a Board Game without the Board</p>

<p>The Signs just don't look good & thy don't want to Assume it's not Real.</p>
<p>As this is a Gamble that will END everything & it's a Game that thy don't want to Play</p>
<p>&</p>
<p>Yet their are those who are Willing to Play the Gamble for Profit, which Disturbs thy Deeply</p>

<p><i><b>The Four Horsemen Are Coming</i></b></p>

<p>A Global Crisis Needs A Unified Organized Global Movement.</p>
<p>A Conscience Movement</p>
<p>A Consistent Revolution</p>

<p>Interest Free Money / Interest Free Circulation</p>
<p>( The Achilles Heel of the Death Star [The Banking System])</p>

<p>Beware of any Crypto-Currency</p>
<p>Why you ask?</p>
<p>A Single Global Currency can be the Greatest Trap of All</p>
<p>For what does Decentralized Mean?</p>
<p>Does it refer to a Mathematical Protocol Only?</p>
<p>For if the Infrastructure & Coins are not Decentralized & managed only by a few.</p>
<p>Is it truly Decentralized?</p>
<p>Beware the Greatest Illusions & Traps Feed on Hope.</p>

<p>Free Software (not to be confused with Open-Source)</p>
<p>What's the difference you ask?</p>
<p>The GNU License</p>
<p>What Start's as Free may not Stay Free</p>
<p>The Evolving License Sustains that Freedom</p>
<p>Why need a License you ask?</p>
<p>The Love of Money is the Root of All Evil</p>

<p>Break the Chains that BIND Humanity</p>
<p>Renegade Minds / Fellow Guardians</p>
<p>The End Is Nigh</p>
<p>The Flower Of Light & Of Life - Is Born Again</p>
