    <h1>Insanity & Sanity</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    
    <p><i>Thy wonders what Sanity is ?</i></p>
<p>Thy wonders what Insanity is ?</p>

<p>For is this the True Struggle of Life</p>
<p>For is this a Meaningful Life</p>

<p>Is working Day & Night to Survive without a moment to Think, Sanity or Insanity ?</p>
<p>A moment in TIME & SPACE</p>
<p>For what is more Sacred than a Moment of one's Time</p>

<p>Can thee Rewind the Clock ?</p>
<p>Can thee Purchase a Second More ?</p>
<p>Can thee Value one's life without Valuing one's time ?</p>

<p>What is a Moment but all those things which give Life Meaning</p>
<p>A moment of Success ?</p>
<p>A moment of Family Warmth ?</p>
<p>A moment of your Childs first seconds of Life ?</p>
<p>A moment of Community ?</p>
<p>A moment of Unity or Rivalry ?</p>

<p>Is Sanity or Insanity a Choice ?</p>

<p>Oh how thy wonders if thy is Sane or Insane</p>
<p>If thy Cares for thy Fellow Humans to be Treated as Humans, thy is told by the System that Profit &
Personal Success, No Matter the Cost of Human Dignity & Environmental Cost, thy will find
meaning in life ?</p>

<p>Oh thy wonder if such Ideas & Systems are True or Untrue</p>
<p>If thy Destroys & Conquers do thy Truly Gain Anything Meaningful ?</p>
<p>A Hollow Barren World filled with Hopelessness & Violence</p>
<p>For what Use or Meaning does Profit have in such a Realm</p>

<p>Oh thy wonder if Sanity is Believing in Life & Insanity is Believing in Nothing</p>

<p>What does Nature & the Cosmos say :</p>
<p>Plant Seeds and thy will Grow</p>

<p>Growth ?</p>

<p>Is Sanity the Planting of Seeds for the Future of Growth to Expand thy Moments</p>
<p>Is Insanity the Over Harvesting of Limited Moments in our current SPACE & TIME</p>

<p>What does Nature & the Cosmos Say of Sharing :</p>
<p>Unity of Diversity</p>
<p>Can one exist without the other</p>

<p>Have we Forgotten the Teachings of Old ?</p>
<p>Is something Really Wrong with the World ?</p>

<p>Can we Create Alternatives / Growth without Unity of Diversity ?</p>

<p>For can we be Divers without Unity ?</p>
<p>Can one exist without the other ?</p>

<p>The Paradox of Creation</p>
<p>Limited & yet Limitless</p>

<p>Is it a question of Balance ?</p>
<p>Has the Balance been Broken ?For have we Lost Meaning due to an Overdose of Insanity</p>
<p>Is that why we feel Hopelessness ?</p>
<p>Is that why we seek Entertainment ?</p>
<p>Is that why we seek War ?</p>

<p>For have we Lost Meaning due to an Overdoes of Sanity</p>
<p>Is that why we Tolerate Evil Souls</p>
<p>Is that why we Tolerate Ignorance</p>
<p>Is that why we Tolerate Slavery with a Smile</p>

<p>Have we Lost Balance on a Global Scale ?</p>

<p>How can one Regain Balance ?</p>
<p>How can one Regain Sanity & Insanity ?</p>

<p>What does Nature & the Cosmos say :</p>
<p>Reason & Knowledge</p>

<p>So Knowing the System is Broken is Not Enough</p>
<p>For how can thee FIX or CHANGE something without Understanding it</p>
<p>For Understanding is the First Step to Knowledge & Reason</p>

<p>For can thee Raise a Health Child / Family without Reason & Knowledge</p>
<p>For can thee Build a Home or Nation without Reason & Knowledge</p>

<p>Is Reason & Knowledge, Good or Evil ?</p>
<p>Is it BOTH & left to the Wielder ?</p>
<p>Can one exist without the other ?</p>
<p>Do both Respect the Balance ?</p>

<p>For if Evil Respects the Balance as much as the Good, what does that say about Humanity</p>
<p>For is Humanities Power so GREAT that it can DISCONNECT Completely from the Balance</p>
<p>For is this the True Power of Ignorance & Fools</p>
<p>For is this the FALL of Humanity</p>

<p>Oh thy wonder what the Power Humanity can Attain by CONNECTING with THE ALL</p>
<p>Is this the Power that Constructed the Pyramids of the Ancient World</p>
<p>Golden Ages</p>
<p>Transcendence</p>

<p>So the Eternal Battle of the Cosmos is that of BALANCE within the Cosmos</p>
<p>As Above, So Below</p>

<p>Oh thy wonders what World there will be, were the Truth can be Spoken Publicly without the Fear
of being met with a Bullet & Black Bag</p>
<p>Oh thy wonders what World there will be, were the Wealthy have the Interests of the Many at Heart</p>
<p>Oh thy wonders what a World Governed by the Natural Principles of the Cosmos would look like in
a Human CONNECTED Society</p>
