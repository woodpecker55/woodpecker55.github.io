    <h1>Minimalism</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Minimalism seems to be some New Forked Branch from the <u>Eastern Philosophy of the Dao.</u></p>
    
<i>The Art of Letting Go / Flow / Less is More</i>

<p>Maybe Something Old has taken on a New Form / Idea</p>

<p>There are many ways to Express an Idea but none as so clear as the thought that Planted the Seed.</p>

<p>So we are left to Choose Forms of Ideas, Knowing it to be a Lie & Truth. Like a Tiger fearful of the
Wild & enjoying our Luxuries Cage.</p>

<p><b>So lets mix it up Tyler Durden</b> <i>Style / Fight Club Film</i>

<h2>Let Go!</h2>

<p>Reject the basic assumptions of civilization - especially the importance of material possessions -
<i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>The things you own end up owning you. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>Time to stand up for what you believe in. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control
everything, and just let go! LET GO! - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive.
You're not the contents of your wallet. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<p>What do you want? Wanna go back to the shit job, fucking condo world, watching sitcoms? Fuck
You - I won't do it. - <i>"Tyler Durden"</i></p>

<h2>The Daily Minimalist Game</h2>

<p>Evaluate and Examine</p>
<p>Make the bed after getting up = a Domino Effect</p>
<p>Wax On, Wax Off, Wax On, Wax Off</p>

<h2>The 5 Types of Minimalism</h2>

<p><b>- Aesthetic</b><p>

<p>More Space / Less Visual Distractions</p>

<p>The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is Imperfect, Impermanent and Incomplete.</p>

<p><b>- Digital</b><p>

<p>Us technology to Decrease the Quantity & Increase the Quality of your Backpack</p>

<p>Photo Scanning Party = Joy</p>

<p><b>- Experientialism</b></p>

<p>I don't have Time = It's not a Priority</p>

<p>Learn First Aid = It's good to be Prepared for an Emergency</p>

<p>Volunteer = Sometimes the best way to get out of your head is to help other people.</p>

<p>Visit the Opera = Escape from the News Cycle by immersing yourself in the Drama of an Opera Performance</p>

<p>Go to the Aquarium = It's almost impossible to recreate the Strange Grace and Tranquillity of Aquariums </p>

<p>Play a Board Game = Self - Explanatory</p>

<p>Read a Book = Self Love</p>

<p>Go to the Museums or Galleries = Confusion</p>

<p><b>- Environmental</b></p>

<p>Loosening the Chains of the Consumerist God = Power to the People only when replaced with the Good</p>

<p><b>- Mindful</b></p>

<p>Has a Meditation aspect in doing the Practice but only done Naturally / Flow.</p>

<p>to Be or Not to Be</p>

<p><b>No Junk Rule</b></p>

<p><b>Declutter / Purge</b></p>

<p>Don't Guilt Yourself</p>
<p>Keep / Re-Use Box = Sentimentals & Usefuls</p>
<p>Repair / Fix Box = Damaged Usefuls</p>
<p>Sell Box = If you can Why Not & If Not that's alright, that's Letting Go</p>
<p>Donate Box = Anyone & Everyone</p>
<p>Recycle Box = Character</p>

<p><h2>Seasonality Rule</h2></p>

<p>Be like the Seasons Nursing and Valuing what you have now for it will Return to the World</p>

<p>The Ability of a powerful group to reward those who agree with it and punish those who don't also
distorts the marketplace of ideas. This isn't about corruption - beliefs naturally shift in accord with
interests. As Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his
salary depends on not understanding it." The result can be an entire society twisted to serve the
interests of its most powerful group. -<i> Winners Take All / The Elite Charade of Changing the
World / Book / Anad Giridharadas</i></p>

<p><b>Emergency Items Rule</b></p>

<p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step - Lao Tzu</p>
