    <h1>The Dude Abides Manifesto</h1>
    <i>Take it Easy - "The Dude"</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Admit that the whole world has gone crazy. We may be powerless over it. But we can take care of
our own private residence.</p>
<br/>
<p>Believe there is a Dude Way to the Universe.</p>
<br/>
<p>Be determined to follow the Dude Way. And to follow it further on down the trail.</p>
<br/>
<p>Where's the meaning, Lebowski? It's down there somewhere, take another look.</p>
<br/>
<p>Say, "Fuck it." That's your answer for everything.</p>
<br/>
<p>Take long baths and meditate on your rug.</p>
<br/>
<p>What in God's holy name are they blathering about? That's just like their opinions, man</p>
<br/>
<p>Be the Dude to everyone you meet.</p>
<br/>
<p>Be there, man</p>
<br/>
<p>Stop making illiterate connections.</p>
<br/>
<p>Adhere to a strict drug regimen to keep your mind limber.</p>
<br/>
<p>Spread the Dude word.</p>
