    <h1>Wabi Sabi.html</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
  <p>Wabi-Sabi was established during the Edo Period in Japan. The Philosophy was adopted by the
mainstream culture for multiple Reasons. I recommend you personally re-awaken your inner
Curiosity and Recover the Treasuries of the Past.</p>
<br/>
<p>Even so, I will try my best to compress the <b>Historical, Cultural, Economical, Environmental,
Political and Philosophical Reasons</b> of the adoption and formation of the Wabi-Sabi Philosophy
into the world of Japan and with Time to the rest of the World.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>For the Truth is that no Blog can deliver that solid Understanding that of a Book and no Book that
Deep Understanding that of History / Time.</i></p>
<br/>
<h2>History</h2>
<br/>
<p>Japan during this time had to address a changing Country / People in a changing World
The Motto of History. <b>So say we All</b></p>

<p>Historically Japan has always been conservative towards its Natural Resources. As a Continent of
Limited Space and Natural Resources.</p>

<p>Know this my Fellow Citizen when Thou reads Limited don't mistake it for a lack of Quality.<p>

<p>Each has their Place and Value.</p>

<p>So the concept of Wabi-Sabi addressed Environmental Concerns through a Cultural value of Less is
more through valuing, what you do have but <u>Including and Accepting</u> <b>Time, Age and Death</b></p>

<p>Which nurtures a Practice of Patience and Local Support for the Community or one could even say
that all that was done was a re-channeling of what was already there.</p>

<p>Which most certainly is Truer than I partly.</p>

<p>The Truth is that the philosophy of the Collective had a sense of Unity that Embraced Time which
allow the Continent the Develop in a Balanced way. As it Gifted Time and Support to Local
Business over the more Skilled and Cheaper products from China.</p>

<p>True Education / Skill = Time + Curiosity + Resources + Support + Patience + Love</p>

<p>The philosophy was also accepted due most likely to not staying to far from it's eastern philosophy
Roots to the Dao</p>

<p><i>There can be no existence without non-existence.</i></p>
<p>No difficult without easy</p>
<p>No long without short</p>
<p>No high without low</p>
<p>And without the sounds of musical instruments and human voices, where would their
harmony - and cacophony - be?</p>
<i>- Dao De Jing</i>

<p>So simply change peoples relationship with <b>Time / Death</b> and before Thou eyes the Impossible
will become Possible.</p>

<p><b>Nothing lasts</b></p>
<p><b>Nothing is finished</b></p>
<p><b>Nothing is perfect</b></p>

<h2>Wabi Sabi</h2>

<p>A way of living that focuses on finding beauty with the Imperfection and Impermanence of
life.</p>

<p>A way of life that appreciates and accepts complexity while at the same time values
simplicity.</p>

<p><b>- Wabi :</b> Simplicity</p>

<p><b>- Sabi :</b> Appreciation of the Age and Imperfect</p>

<b>Kintsukuroi :</b>

<p>â€¢ To repair with gold, the art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer and understanding
that the piece is more beautiful for have been broken</p>

<b><u>Discourse</u></b>

<p>Grab a plate and throw it on the ground</p>
<p>- Okay, done</p>
<p>Did it break?</p>
<p>-Yes</p>
<p>Now say sorry to it</p>
<p>- Sorry</p>
<p>Did it go back to the way it was before?</p>
<p>- No</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Listen closely for Truth whispers, To Know is not to Understand.</p>
