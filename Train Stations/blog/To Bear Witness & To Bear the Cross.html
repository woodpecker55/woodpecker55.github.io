    <h1>To Bear Witness & To Bear the Cross</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p><i>Fellow Souls, I have Gazed into the Abyss & something Gazed back & as if a whisper
reach out with a Gift. Thy GIFT, the Forbidden Fruit.</i></p>

<p>Excuse the Metaphors but best such things be Spoken so, until Empathy for the Wretched of the
Earth is know by both parties.</p>

<p>but do Entertain my Madness, with your beautiful Company.</p>

<p>If you would?</p>

<p>I have enjoyed the Journey of Life, Moments in Time & Memory but unknown'st to this Traveller
that the Curiosity of Life & Truth, would Bear a Fruit of Self - Conciseness. Not to be confused
with Conciseness.</p>

<p>With this New Found Soul, A Soul Forgotten</p>

<p>The Traveler Lost Everything, For Betrayal was Not New, Nor was Failure & Nor was Heart Break</p>

<p>But Freedom, was Unspeakable.</p>

<p>To see the Light Accompanied by Shadow in Every Corner of the Cosmos. Beautiful</p>

<p>For you know what it is to help people. A Messy Affair indeed & yet more Meaningful than Self Achievement.</p>

<p>For it can be Hard, as some Souls enslave themselves though Ignorance but who can blame such Souls.</p>

<p>For Ignorance is Bless</p>

<p>As the Traveller went about the Journey, thy encountered many Souls, Good & Evil.</p>

<p>Acceptance of Truth, Sank Deep</p>

<p>And thus the Choice, To Bear Witness</p>

<p>Witness the Oppression & Subjection of thy Fellow Sisters & Brothers.</p>

<p>By a System, By Design & Even By Themselves</p>

<p>The Enemy of Humanity - Greed & Debt & Ignorance</p>

<p>For if the Boot is on your Neck, Does it matter of the Colour of the Foot in the Boot?</p>

<p>For the Intellectual Option, Does not always Align with The Moral & thus the Traveller stood for
the people even if thy Stood Alone</p>

<p>For why hate those who fear to act, Courage is not Distributed Equally & thus it would be a
Disservice to not use the Gift for the service of the many.</p>

<p>Each has their Gift & Part to play, then why shy from it but it is Key to first know thy part.</p>

<p>though Time (Destiny followed by Necessity equals Order / The Holy Trinity / 3,4,5) has its Fun
playing with the Rhythms of Life.</p>

<p>So the Traveller Lives But also Lives for the Past, So that the Future May Inherit Flowers & Fruits
of Fairness to come.</p>

<p>The Debt must be Repaid / And Forgive them their Debts</p>

<p>The Republic will be Reborn Again.</p>

<p>It is needed from Time to Time.</p>

<p>To Fortify One's Soul.</p>

<p>If need a Guide, Wonder thy Library which has be build for all the Children of the Morning</p>

<p>For the Guardians are Forever at work in Restoring Humanity & Teachings Forgotten.</p>

<p>So they may walk amongst the Gods/Parthenon's Once More</p>

<p>For the GIFT to See the Mountaintop is in Reach</p>

<p>Storm the Gates of Hell,</p>
<p>As One, One Mind, One Being</p>
<p>Pulling Body and Soul</p>

<p>So that the Ancestors, Ancients and The ALL</p>
<p>may walk on Earth Once More</p>
<p>and the Heavens reflected Below.</p>
<p>As the Balance should be</p>

<p>As Above, So Below</p>
<p>Rise as does the Morning Sun</p>
