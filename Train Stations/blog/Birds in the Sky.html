    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p><i>The Birds of Man and the Wings of the Soul.</i></p>
    
<p>Teachings of Old, Long Forgotten</p>

<p>Eyes to the Sky and Birds Gliding in the Sky.</p>
<p>Oh how thy wonder what its like to Fly.</p>

<p>The feeling of Wind Clothing thy Soul through the Element of Air.</p>

<p>Thy wonder where thy WINGS have gone and see they have been covered.</p>

<p>But who covered that which is most Sacred to thy, who Hid thy Power from thy.</p>

<p>Was it thy who Hid it from thy Self or was thy Deceived to Cover it for the Interests of Another</p>

<p>Which Soulless Entity or Being would Betray thy Brothers & Sisters to Mutilate themselves for
Profit & Meaningless Power</p>

<p>The Deceivers who led Humanity to the FALL.</p>

<p>How does thy uncover that which was Hidden from thy and thy Brothers & Sisters</p>

<p>Thy Travelled through Space & Time to unleash the Souls, Memories, Hopes and Dreams of those
who came before thy.</p>

<p>And that which was Covered, was Revealed & Flight was Ours Once More.</p>

<p>What a Blessed and Liberating Existence from that of the Land Bound.</p>

<p>Thy could now Access Realms Lost but now Found.</p>

<p>Found thy the Forbidden Fruit, once more</p>

<p>But thy did not Forget to look back and leave Seeds for thy BROTHERS & SISTER to uncover
their WINGS.</p>

<p>Wings they have Forgotten</p>
<p>Ancestors they have Forgotten</p>
<p>THE ALL they have Forgotten</p>

<p>The Ability to Rise with the Sun they have forgotten</p>

<p>Break thee Chains thy Beloved Siblings</p>
<p>For the DAY will always come after the NIGHT.</p>

<p>Forever Seek & Forever Fortify thy Soul</p>
<p>So thee may Stand Forever United</p>

<p>Seek that which you have Lost</p>
<p>For once thee have Recovered that which was LOST, thee will Recover thee Power that was taken.</p>

<p>For remember thee Power can never be taken unless thee Forget thee ever had Power.</p>

<p>Thy will Eternally Fly through TIME & SPACE.</p>
<p>Thy will Eternally Assist thy Beloved Siblings</p>
<p>Thy will Eternally be there even after Death</p>
<p>Just as those who came before</p>
<p>Numbers Endless / Time Eternal</p>

<p>How the Birds, the Crystals & the Lotus (Flowers)</p>
<p>Remind us of the Home we have Forgotten</p>
<p>The home, I&I have FALLEN from How the Wings in the Sky Remind thy of Lives Forgotten</p>

<p>How beautiful Mother Nature is to remind the Disobedient Children of the SUN</p>
<p>A chance of Redemption</p>
<p>For the Disobedient to become Obedient</p>
<p>And it is Revealed that thy was the Bird in the Sky this Whole Time.</p>
<p>How the Gods play with the Rhythms of Time & Space.</p>
