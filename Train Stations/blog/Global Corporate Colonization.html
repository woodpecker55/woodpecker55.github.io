    <h1>Global Corporate Colonization</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>33 April 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>What do you see, when you look at the World / Vibration?</p>
    
<p>Humanity or Corporate Profit at the Life Blood of the Collective Humanity?</p>
<p>The Wretched Of The Earth?</p>
<p>Human Souls or the balance of your bank account?</p>

<p>For if we could prove scientifically the existence of the Soul, would you Accept it or Deny it?</p>

<p>For one thing I do know is if Souls exist, our World as we know it will Collapse because you
wouldn’t be able to treat people/humans the way you do.</p>

<p>For what does this simple TRUTH reveal about our Religions / Systems / Spirituality / Minds/
Culture?</p>

<p>The Masquerade of Denial</p>
<p>People call themselves consumers in this Masquerade / System.</p>

<p>What is a consumer?</p>
<p>How do you make one?</p>

<p>Follow me down this Rabbit Hole, if you Seek the Collective Humanity’s Soul</p>

<p>A consumer is an Addict (The Wendigo)</p>
<p>What creates Addiction?</p>

<p>TRAUMA</p>

<p>A System / Masquerade that creates Traumatized humans to sell temporary fixes to address the Void
within, created by the System / Masquerade to make a Profit. Over & Over.</p>

<p>It’s a powerful System / Masquerade,</p>
<p>The System knows what it’s doing.</p>

<p>Case & Point</p>

<p>South Africa, the Rainbow Nation.</p>
<p>The Dream / Hope of Unity by Diversity.</p>
<p>Is being undone.</p>

<p>An act of Treason of the Highest Order to Humanity.</p>
<p>To KILL an Infant of HOPES & DREAMS for a new path of Unity by Diversity.</p>

<p>Fellow Souls & Guardians, the Age of Corporate Colonization is upon us ALL.</p>
<p>It’s Tools of Illusion are vast & many fall prey to the Masquerade.</p>

<p>South Africa, they talk of State Capture.</p>
<p>What is State Capture?</p>
<p>Corruption or Coup?</p>
<p>NO!, my Fellow Humanity.</p>
<p>It’s the Re-Colonization of the African Continent by Corporations</p>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Automation / Mechanization</p>
<p>Do entertain my thought till it Fruits.</p>

<p>For we have spoken of the Masquerade & it’s Addiction for Profit even at the Cost of ALL
Humanity & Life itself</p>

<p>The Global Corporate Parasite has no loyalty to Race / Class / Religion / State / Culture or
Universal Law</p>

<p>For we have Lost the Way & Are met with a fork in the Road</p>

<p>One Road of HOPE by Unity by Diversity</p>
<p>Another Road of Destruction by Greed</p>

<p>Why worry about Automation you ask?</p>

<p>The Weapons of War can be re-shaped / re-engineered for the purpose of Nurturing Life</p>

<p>A Hammer can be used to build a Shelter or Smash Skulls</p>
<p>A barrel can be used to collect water for the renewal of Life or dissolve a body</p>

<p>The Internet can be used to Connect people & Share knowledge across the Globe or Mass
Surveillance, Mass Manipulation, Cyber Warfare (World War 3 – The Silent War / Revolution)</p>

<p>Climate Change will Cause Resource Scarcity (World War 4 – Water etc..)</p>
<p>Colonisation of the past was a Power Game, Survival will be the New Game</p>
<p>There is no Historical Reference for a Global War of Resource Scarcity</p>
<p>Yes, thing can get much much worse for ALL HUMANITY & LIFE</p>

<p>Automation / Mechanization can be used to Liberate humans from Dangerous or Labour Intense
work or used to Enslave Humanity through Economic & Production means</p>

<p>Why worry about Africa, you ask?</p>

<p>This Attack on Humanity is Global & thus we must THINK & ACT Global – Unity by Diversity</p>
<p>There are many tasks to be done & there are many Fellow Souls & Guardians</p>

<p>Do not fall for the Illusion of Divide & Conquer</p>

<p>North Korea & South Korea – once One</p>
<p>Pakistan & India – once One</p>
<p>China & Taiwan – once One</p>
<p>North America, now multiple states – once One</p>
<p>Africa, now multiple countries – once One</p>
<p>Now South Africa, divided by province & some are trying to become countries of their own – once
One</p>

<p>Same goes for Race / Religion / Identity / Ideology / Culture / Language etc......</p>

<p>We are not Labels, We are One Consciousness</p>
<p>One Red Blood Cell of the Collective Humanity</p>
<p>Quantum Physics</p>
<p>Meta Physics</p>

<p>Fellow Souls / Guardians / Artisans, Our HOPE / DREAMS /STRENGTH / HUMANITY depend
on Unity by Diversity</p>

<p>The Universal God / The Wheel Of Time has spoken</p>

<p>Remember the Song “You raise me up” by Josh Groban</p>
<p>“You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be”</p>

<p>The Global Age of Darkness is Done & The Dawn of Light is Nigh</p>

<p>Humanity is Eternal, we will plant seeds of HOPE Eternally</p>

<p>The Ancestors & God’s of ALL are with us</p>
<p>WE SHARE ONE CONSCIOUSNESS</p>

<p>The Flower Of Light & Of Life</p>

<p>“Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so
many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already. Will it happen overnight? No.
Will it happen in a lifetime? I don't know. Is it worth fighting for until my last breath. Of course.
Once you've seen what's possible, how can you do otherwise? - DPR</p>
