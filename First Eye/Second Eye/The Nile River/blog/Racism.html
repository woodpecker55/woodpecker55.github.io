    <h1>Racism</h1>
    
    <p>What Are Your Thoughts On Racism?</p>
    
    <p>Let's Keep It Simple For Many Like To Make It Complex - So It Cannot Be Solved - It's Like The Law System - With Loop Holes</p>
    
    <p>Male?</p>
    
    <p>Female?</p>
    
    <p>Race?</p>
    
    <p>Ideology?</p>
    
    <p>Gender?</p>
    
    <p>Age?</p>
    
    <p>Colour?</p>
    
    <p>To Me Are irrelevant - I Will Go More Into Detail Below</p>
    
    <p>Anything That Prevents My Evolution - I Change It</p>
    
    <p>So Be It Balck OR White Facisim - I Crush It - For Evolving To Survive The Cosmic Threat Comes First (Solar Outburst) - If Your Basic's Ain't Covered (Solid Foundation) Everything After Falls, With Time</p>
    
    <p> Imagine All That Sacrifice To Build For Nothing - I Would Be MAD As Hell</p> 
    
    <p> This Applies To All Things - Genetic's / Culture / Civilization & More</p>
    
    <p>I Am Putting It In A Cold Manner For The Sake Of The Discourse</p>
    
    <p>But For Reminder - I Think Everything Must Be Done With LOVE</p>
    
    <p>What Purpose Doe's Racism Play In The Long Run = The Extintion Of The Human Race Over Time = Think Of It As A Mind Parasite That Tricks The Whole Species To Divide & Not Share Genetic Material To The Point, That Their Gene Pools Die Out = A Slow Death Through Stupidity</p>
    
    <p>So It Serves No One</p>
    
    <p>That's Correct</p>
    
    <p>It Was The Most Foolish Concept Ever Created But As A Species Destroyer, It Works</p>
