<center><h2>The Ancient Egyptian Prophecy : Thoth's Message To
Humanity</h2></center>

<p>Art you not aware,</p>

<p>Asclepius, that Egypt is the image of heaven, or rather, that it is the projection below of the order
of things above? If the truth must be told, this land is indeed the temple of the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since sages ought to foresee all things, there is one thing you must know; a time
will come when it will seem that the Egyptians have adored the Gods so piously in vain, and that
all their holy invocations have been barren and unheeded. </p>

<p>Divinity will quit the Earth and return
to heaven, forsaking Egypt, its ancient abode, and leaving the land widowed of religion and bereft
of the presence of the Gods. </p>

<p>Strangers will fill the Earth, and not only will sacred things be
neglected, but – more dreadful still – religion, piety, and the adoration of the Gods will be
forbidden and punished by the laws.</p> 

<p>Then, this Earth, hallowed by so many shrines and temples,
will be filled with sepulchers and with the dead. O Egypt! Egypt! there will remain of your
religions only vague legends that posterity will refuse to believe; only words graven upon stones
will witness to your devotion! The Scythian, the Indian, or some other neighboring barbarian will
possess Egypt! Divinity will return to heaven; humanity, thus abandoned, will wholly perish, and
Egypt will be left deserted, forsaken of men and of Gods!</p>

<p>"To you I cry, O most sacred River, to you I announce the coming doom! Waves of blood,
polluting your divine Waters, shall overflow your banks; the number of the dead shall surpass that
of the living; and if, indeed, a few inhabitants of the land remain, Egyptians by speech, they will
in manners be aliens! </p>

<p>You weep, Asclepius! But yet sadder things than these will come to pass.</p>

<p>Egypt will fall into apostasy, the worst of all evils. </p>

<p>Egypt, once the holy land beloved of the Gods
and full of devotion for their worship, will become the instrument of perversion, the school of
impiety, the type of all violence. </p>

<p>Then, filled with disgust for everything, man will no longer feel
either admiration or love for the world. He will turn away from this beautiful work, the most
perfect alike in the present, the past, and the future. </p>

<p>Nor will the languor and weariness of soulspermit anything to remain save disdain of the whole universe, this immutable work of God, this
glorious and perfect edifice, this manifold synthesis of forms and images, wherein the will of the
Lord, lavish of marvels, has united all things in a harmonious and single whole, worthy for ever
of veneration, of praise and love! </p>

<p>Then darkness will be preferred to light, and death will be
deemed better than life, nor will any man lift his eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>"In those days the religious man will be youth mad; the impious man will be hailed as a sage;
savage men will be deemed valiant; the evil-hearted will be applauded as the best of men.</p> 

<p>The
Soul, and all that belongs thereto, whether born mortal or able to attain eternal life, all those
things that I have herein expounded to you, will be but matters for ridicule, and will be esteemed
foolishness. </p>

<p>There will even be peril of death, believe me, for those who remain faithful to
religion and intelligence. </p>

<p>New rights will be instituted, new laws, nor will there be left one holy
word, one sacred belief, religious and worthy of heaven and of celestial things. </p>

<p>O lamentable
separation between the Gods and men! Then there will remain only evil demons who will mingle
themselves with the miserable human race, their hand will be upon it impelling to all kinds of
wicked enterprise; to war, to rapine, to falsehood, to everything contrary to the nature of the soul.</p>

<p>The Earth will no longer be in equilibrium, the sea will no longer be navigable, in the heavens the
regular course of the stars will be troubled. Every holy voice will be condemned to silence; the
fruits of the Earth will become corrupt, and she will be no more fertile; the very Air will sink into
lugubrious torpor. </p>

<p>Such will be the old age of the world; irreligion and disorder, lawlessness, and
the confusion of good men.</p>

<p>"When all these things shall be accomplished, O Asclepius, then the Lord and Father, the
sovereign God who rules the wide world, beholding the evil ways and actions of men, will arrest
these misfortunes by the exercise of His divine will and goodness. </p>

<p>And, in order to put an end to
error and to the general corruption, He will drown the world with a deluge or consume it by Fire,
or destroy it by wars and epidemics, and thereafter He will restore to it its primitive beauty; so
that once more it shall appear worthy of admiration and worship, and again a chorus of praise and
of blessing shall celebrate Him Who has created and redeemed so beautiful a work. </p>

<p>This rebirth
of the world, this restoration of all good things, this holy and sacred rehabilitation of Nature will
take place when the time shall come that is appointed by the divine and ever-eternal will of God,
without beginning and always the same."Literature Studies :</p>
