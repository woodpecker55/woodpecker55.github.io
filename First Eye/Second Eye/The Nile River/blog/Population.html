    <h1>Population</h1>
    
   <p> What Makes Humanity Stable - A Balance Between Males & Females </p>
    
    <p>Let's Keep It Simple - Due To The Fact That Factores Are Different In Different Locations But The Principle Is The Same</p>
    
    <p>A Imbalance = At Some Point, Leads To A Massive Drop In Population If The Ratio Of Males & Females Is Imbalanced = A Decrease In Skills/Maintains Of The Whole & Will Lead To The Collapse In The Civilization  </p> 
    
    <p>Genetic Cycle Of Evolution </p>
    
    <p>Human's Go Through A State Of Flux = 1 - A Full House Mix Of Genetic Humans = 2 - A Separation Of Human Genetic's, Leads To More Colours For The Canvas = 3 - A Return To The Full House Mix Of Genetic Humans = Atlantian </p>
    
    <p>Why Does This Happen ?</p>
    
    <p>The Seperation Of The Gene's Have A Limited Shelf Life</p>
    
    <p>The Laws Of Nature</p>
    
    <p>Think Of It Like Granny Cooking A Mixed Pie</p>
    
    <p>Does This Threaten The Culture/Tradtion?</p>
    
    <p>Culture & Tradtions Transcend Material Vessels</p>
