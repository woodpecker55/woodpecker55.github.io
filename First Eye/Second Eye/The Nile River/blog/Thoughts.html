    <h1>Thoughts On The Sun</h1>
    <i>Introduction</i>
    <date>04 Sep 2023</date>
    <br/><br/>
    
    <h1>Thought's On The Sun</h1>
    
    <p>There Are Many Threats To The Existance Of Humanity On The Planet & From The Cosmos</p>
    
    <p>The One That Peaks My Intrest Is That Of The Sun's Ability For A Cosmic Solar Out Burst</p>
    
    <p>Why Doe's This Intrest You?</p>
    
    <p>People Understand The Damage That A EMP (Electromagnetic pulse) Can Do</p>
    
    <p>Though The Idea Of A Cosmic One Is Mind Blowing but Im curious If It's Also Literal</p>
    
    <p>What Do You Mean?</p>
    
    <p>So We Know That Every Motherboard Or Machine Will Stop To Function & Humanity Will Collapse But Here Is The Spice</p>
    
    <p>If The Human Brain Is A Electric Power System, Could Not A Cosmic EMP Stop It From Working </p>
    
    <p>Think Of That Mind Eraser Flash Machine They Had In Men In Black But Instead Of Memory Wipe - Death</p>
    
    <p>Im Sure This Has Happend Before, The Thing That Fascinates I Is That Some Had To Have Survived & Evolved To Survive The Next Way</p>
    
    <p>Those To Me Are The Atlantians - The Ultimate Genetics = For Long Term Survival (That's The Key) Natures Laws</p>
    
    <p>Able To Survive Not Only Natural Law Of The Earth But Of The Cosmos</p>
    
    <p>I Don't Think There Are Many With This Gene On The Planet</p>
    
    <p>Why Do You Think This?</p>
    
    <p>You Already Know The Answer But I Will Put It In A Simple Way = Human's Have A Habit Of Destorying Thing That Are Of Great Value & Then Only Understaning It's Value One's It's Gone</p>
    
    <p>As I Have Said Before - I Don't Need To Fight, I Can Just Sit Back & Watch The Show & Let The Universe Do It's Thing</p>
    
    <p>& To Keep It Humble & So There Is No Cofusion</p>
    
    <p>That Ability To Reboot The Brain Must Be In The Gene's Of The Most Divers/Mixed Humans</p>
    <p>For A PC Needs Many Part's To Reboot - Complexity Is Important To The Cosmos - For The Cosmos Is Complex In It's Simplicity - Now That's Art</p>
    
    <p>So Those Who Have Done Selective Breeding - (You Know Who You Are) Have Made A Error Due To Your Need For Appearance - You Focused On The Outer Look More Than You Did On The Inner Details But That's Not Your Fault (It's Human Pride - We All Have A Moment - Nothing Wrong With A Artist Proud Of There Work But Art Is Always On The Move & Changing) - Like I Said There Are Many Virus's In The Collective Human Mind - So Such Error Can't Be Avoid Till You Unfilter & Create A Solid Foundation In The Collective Human Mind</p>
    
    <p>This Is Not Really Of Interest To Myself But I Understand It Important For Some - So Just Meeting You Have Way</p>
    
    <p>So That's Why Colour / Race Mean Nothing To You?</p>
    
    <p>If Your Talking About Evolution, Why Box Yourself In To Such A Small Range Of Possiblities</p>
    
    <p>Wouldn't It Just Stall Your Evolution? - Food For Thought</p>
    
    <p>What Are Your Biology Thoughts On This Matter?</p>
    
    <p>I Have Yet To Come A Cross Such A Program That Follow's Natural Law - No One Cooks Better Than Mother Nature - If It Follow's Natures Law - I Will Find It Intresting But All So Far Seem To Follow Human Made Up Laws Or A Corrupted View Of Natures Law = Which Never Survive Or End Well In The Long Run</p>
    
    <p>Just To Make It Clear - Wiping Out Other Races Doesn't Make One Better In My Eye - For That Does Not Mean You Will Survive The Solar Burst Or A Collapse Of A Civilization - Extiction Events In Any Form Usally Leave The Plant In A Weaker State Than It Was</p>
    
    <p> What Do You Mean By This?</p>
    
    <p> Have You Ever Wondered Why People Have A Habit Of Trying To Re-Clone Exticted Animals - I Think Deep Down They Know - Extermination Is Foolish & They Rob Themselves Of Somthing Beautiful</p>
    
    <p>See, When You Stay Humble Through The Thought Proccess - The Unseen Becomes Seen</p>
    
    <p>I Now Know What They Mean By The Pride Before The Fall</p>
    
    <p>It's The Artist's EGO's Death - To Access Greater Art Forms</p>
