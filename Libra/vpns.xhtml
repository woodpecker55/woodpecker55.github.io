            <h1>VPN providers</h1>
            <p class="red">You should only use a VPN when a website / internet service blocks both TOR and I2P. When you buy a VPN you just move your trust from your ISP to a VPN provider (random company). Decentralized technologies are always better for your privacy.</p>
